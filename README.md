# Welcome!
Welcome to this minesweeper game. Customize map sizes and number of mines in its settings page. Future releases will add more customizable options. Not all maps are solvable and sometimes **you must guess**.

## How to play?
Click anywhere to begin. Numbers indicate the number of mines adjacent (including corners) to the square.  Empty squares indicate no mines adjacent to it. Right click to flag squares that you believe have mines. Left click to open squares. Open a square with a mine and game over! Flag all squares with mines to win!
Supports chording (revealing all 8 adjacent squares when the number of adjacent mines equals the number of adjacent flags) by simultaneously right and left clicking.
